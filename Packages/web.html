In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith, a physical education professor 
and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School[5]
 (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep
 his gym class active on a rainy day.<br><br>He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his 
students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. 
After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums,
he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track.
In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls
had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient,
 however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with
 a long dowel each time.
